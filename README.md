# Lab Forward Task
To write a Node-API in C++ to interact with the device. As part of the task I've imagined a boiler and Implemented C++ addon to set the desired temperature and Get the current temperature upon requests. <br>
Though I've worked with NodeJS and C++ in the past, never wrote an addon. <br> After 2-3 hours of reading and going through the sample codes i got the idea to build the addon and interface. It took me 3-4 hrs to write the addon. Considering the time limitation i'm not spending extra time to write the interface in nodejs properly.

The Entry point of the program is main.js, the program can be executed by the following command
```sh 
git clone https://github.com/aadu999/labForwardTask.git
cd labForwardTask
npm install
node .
```
Because of the time limitations I've not documented it properly and neither I've written the test cases.
