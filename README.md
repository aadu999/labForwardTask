# Lab Forward Task
To write a Node-API in C++ to interact with the device. As part of the task I've imagined a boiler and Implemented C++ addon to set the desired temperature and Get the current temperature upon requests. <br>
Though I've worked with NodeJS and C++ in the past, never wrote an addon. <br> After 2-3 hours of reading and going through the sample codes i got the idea to build the addon and interface. It took me 3-4 hrs to write the addon. Considering the time limitation i'm not spending extra time to write the interface in nodejs properly.
